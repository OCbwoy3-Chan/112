OCbwoy3's Super Cool Global Ban Handler for Script Builders.
You can ban players here. Games who use your instance of this will ban sync your bans with theirs. If they're banned in your list, all games using it will not let the user join the server. Self explanatory, really.

You can see ALL preset ban reasons in `AllBanReasons.ts`.

**NOTE: People can access ALL of your GBans by accessing the `/banland.json` endpoint! It's public!**

**How this would look like on [ocbwoy3.dev](https://ocbwoy3.dev/lookup?u=OCboy3)**:

If you are developing/using this on NixOS, if Prisma doesn't work, Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) and then re-open the shell.
